# IMLEEDS Framework.

# This framework has been constructed as a test to show representatives at BOOHOO
# my (Richard Dickinson) abilites using PHP7. This has been done because over the
# years, I've not had chance to work with frameworks like Laravel, Zend or others
# as my work has been fully bespoke, built from the ground up.

# This framework has also been built from the ground up, but having looked at
# Laravel lightly, I saw some major advantages from what they do, you are required
# to list all of your accepted url calls in a route file, I thought this was
# pointless, because we always want some form of output, but after a little bit
# of playing around, I found it easier to 'find' where some content is being
# handled.

# Further to this, I also saw separate route files, such as a web, api and console,
# this let me to seeing such a huge availability of splitting off calls based on
# the request type.

# So this framework has a 'hello-world' test for each type and can be validated
# using:
#
#	1: http: Load the url in the browser '/hello-world'
#	2: api:	Load the url in the browser '/api/hello-world'
#	3: cli:	'php /path/to/artisan hello-world'
